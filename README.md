This repository contains the initial code structure for [The JavaScript Way](https://thejsway.net) book.

## Containerized environment

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can obtain a ready-to-use work environment by following these steps:

1. Install and configure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your local machine.
1. Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
1. In VS Code, open the Command Palette in the `View` menu and select the **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
1. Select the cloned copy of this folder and wait for the container to start.

For chapters using the browser to execute JavaScript code: in the `Ports` tab of Visual Studio Code, click on the **Local Address** link to open a browser tab. Then, navigate to the desired chapter and open any HTML file to launch the corresponding JS code.

For chapters using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to execute JavaScript code: use the Visual Studio Code terminal.
